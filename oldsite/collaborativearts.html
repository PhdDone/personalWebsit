  <div class="title">Design Challenge</div><br/>  
  <p>This project examines how the city is experienced through technology 
and identify the form(s) such experience might take in the following aspects: how interaction design for urban living can take into account the physical location of inhabitants and their movement in the space; how technology supports user activities and behaviors, and shapes 
sociability in the city; and how individual and collective identities and experiences are established 
in and through technologized urban environments.</p><br />
  
<div class="title">Design Process</div><br/>
  <p>Initially, we met as a group to discuss what areas were of most interest to us within the space of urban living.  After our initial round of writing down ideas, we narrowed down to four main domains that were of particular interest to us. They were as follows: Transportation, Public Spaces, Social Life, and Education. We wanted to keep our space fairly broad in the beginning in order for us to be able to go off in a few different directions to take pictures for observation. When we were deciding on where to go for the observations, we picked a fairly broad topic of Public Spaces and decided to go off in different directions for this. We brainstormed about 8 ideas in this space and ultimately settled on the final four topics of Walkways, Bus Stops/Terminals,  Parks, and Bars/Restaurants. Each of us picked one of these areas and went out and observed these locations, taking lots of pictures along 
the way in order to come back and pull insights from our observations.</p><br />
<p>A lot of what we did for research was individual. Throughout the class we 
were shown a lot of different Arduino projects as well as some other existing ideas where spaces were utilized in an urban setting. Our individual brainstorming sessions focused a lot on what we were interested in within the 
space of urban interactions. We did look at a few different exemplars on our own, but primarily what we focused on was thinking critically about problems or issues that we had seen in Bloomington. We thought critically about each of these areas on our own and came together as a group to discuss some of the 
common areas that we appeared to be gravitating towards. We wanted our research and focus area to be in something that we were all interested in and could rally behind to design something for.  
</p><br />
<p>After each of us went our separate ways, we went through and took pictures in the various locations that we observed. We met briefly on a Google Hangout in order to share our findings with each other. We talked a lot about what we observed and common patterns or problems that we saw within the space. We tried to take 
a lot of pictures of various things in our location in order to make observations that might not be so apparent. After we discussed each of our individual observations, we started a small discussion about some of the concept areas that we saw might be potential spots for 
creation of concepts within the space. When we went to class the next day, we were able to come up with right around 40 concepts, 10 each in our individual area. We soon realized that our areas were too disconnected to really validate using a concept map, so we used these 40 concepts that we came up with in order to pick a more solidified area to focus on and concept in. The area that we finally ended up in was Collaborative Artwork. Each of us had seemed to gravitate toward something in this area already and were interested in it, so we decided to focus our energy in this space.  We split up again and began coming up with 10 more
concepts each in this space. We met right before Thanksgiving break to talk about our concepts and place them into a concept map. </p><br/>
<p>From our concept map, we each picked two concepts that we wanted to create low-fidelity prototypes for. Over the break, we constructed our prototypes separately and tested them with the target population. We then individually compiled our information about the test and pulled out some insights and take-aways from each of the prototypes. We then had to 
brainstorm together which of these concepts that we wanted to narrow down again to. This time we were to select our four best concepts and use these four to create one final strong concept that would fit into our problem space 
appropriately. Ultimately, we decided on a Color Mood Wall concept. We really wanted something that would have low barriers to entry. We also wanted many people to be able to contribute to a public piece of artwork. Our concept is one that has the potential to be different every time that you see it, so the 
visual interest of the piece over time should stay pretty high (especially when 
paired with the low barriers to entry). We also wanted the concept to be pretty abstract, allowing for people to critically reflect and ask themselves questions when trying to look at and interpret the design.</p><br/>
<p>We sought a concept that was both engaging as well as something that passersby could enjoy. We feel that this concept is accessible to people within a town as well as people who may just be visiting. Events in a town can often times influence people’s mindsets and behaviors on particular days or over extended amounts of time. For example, in Bloomington 
a big basketball or football game may invoke more red/crimson colors to populate the wall because they are excited about the game happening. Other political events may also encourage red as a bout of anger. Colors can be a very effective way of conveying one’s emotions, and we feel that leaving them 
arbitrary and individually user-defined helps people to think critically not only about what color they decide to pick for the day but also when taking a look at the wall to get a general
feel for the town. It’s a way to allow people to express their opinions in an anonymous and completely safe way. By this we mean that vulgarity and public mischievousness are nearly
impossible with our app. Since this is public-facing we wanted to obtain a design that would be safe for all audiences to view. While being able to draw shapes or present words allows for more explicit and concrete meaning, this also increases the likelihood that people will abuse it and write inappropriate things.  We feel our design has very low barrier to entry and will continue to be something of interest, since it is dynamic and always changing. The final video prototype is shown above.</p><br/>
