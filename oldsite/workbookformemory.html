  <div class="title">Design Challenge</div><br/>  
  <p>This is an individual workbook project. The goal for the workbook is to show people the whole design research and how these research results lead to the concepts. This is an exploration within the whole design space. Follow me with my workbook as PDF above or click the expand to have a view.</p><br/>
  <p>Personal Informatics (PI) tools are working on helping people deal with their daily issue, having a better understanding about themselves and making life and working easier. Most of the PI tools are practical, which means they have specific goals within the design. Users have a clear need when they choose a specific PI tool, for example helping them with time management, tracking their body data to obtain a clear view of the health situation, gaining information to help establish healthy eating habits, etc. Meanwhile, people also have varied comments about these tools. How to improve the current design? How to dig out people’s real needs through these comments and design research? And how to make personal informatics tools simple but efficient?</p><br />
    <p>In this workbook, the topic is around design for memory.  I choose two issues about  memory: how to remember map and how to remember stuff (physical objects and to-do list).</p>
  <br />
<div class="title">Design Process</div><br/>  
  <p>The first survey is about how people remember the map and tell the directions. There are totally 11 respondents, 2 of which became the further subjects for interviews one. The result presents people’s memory situations bout maps, what kind of tools they use to help with maps, and how they use the tools. 91% of the respondents use Google Maps in their daily life and also they rated Google Maps high because of its accuracy and reliability.</p><br/> 
  <p>For the following two interviews, the subjects are two people who have good memory of maps. I asked them what clues they use to remember the maps and tell directions, and we also talked about their opinions about Google Maps, GPS and other mobile applications for maps, which gives me many inspirations for design concepts. </p><br/> 
  <p>I also carried out an observation of these subjects respectively on how they use Google Maps. Typing in/copying and pasting the address, searching, checking the route and following it is the process. They usually use this app to check the map, direction or what is around them.</p><br/> 
  <p>I composed a structured interview about how to remember stuff and did it twice by email and face to face respectively. During the face to face interview I also asked the subject to tell me a whole story about how she lost something and how she  tried  to  recall  where it  was  and  finally  found  it.  At  last  I asked them to talk about their needs on tools to help them to remember stuff. Both of them mentioned they need a simple but powerful tool.</p><br/> 
  <p>After these interviews, I begun to collect comments from iTunes for some productivity PI tools, which includes iPhone Maps, Mapquest, reQall and Shopping (page 6-7). I found not only the suggestions on how to improve the current design but also some clues showing people’s real and deep needs.</p><br/>
