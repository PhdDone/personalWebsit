  <p>The goal for the workbook is to show people the whole design research and how these research results lead to the concepts. This is  an exploration within the whole design space. Follow us with our workbook as PDF above or click the expand to have a view.</p><br/> 

  <p>The design problem we are exploring is around heritage and interaction design. Our team started with oversea Chinese and their cultural heritage. During our design research, we found it interesting that almost all of the Chinese people we spoke to brought one or more kinds of tea with them when they moved abroad. Why did they do this even though not all of them are tea lovers? How have their drinking habits changed after moving abroad? What difficulties do they have when they want to enjoy a Chinese tea ceremony in America? After a series of design research our design concepts are around the topic of “Chinese Tea and Tea Ceremony”. So what could we do, as interaction designers, to help protect and develop Chinese tea culture with design?  </p><br />
<div class="title">Design Process</div><br/>  
  <p>In order to re-frame our design problem and find people who could be our subjects to study, we published our first screening survey to 17 overseas Chinese who are living in America. Moreover, we asked about their opinion about Chinese culture. Most of them strongly agree that overseas Chinese should learn about Chinese history and culture. In conducting this research, we gained a general sense of which direction we should go through this survey.</p><br/>
  <p>After the screening survey, we found seven available people and did the first fieldwork, during which we mainly observed these people talking about their collections they brought with them when moving to America. Interestingly, we found all of these seven subjects had Chinese tea in their place of residence and we learned that they did so because they are a tea lovers or they treat tea as the symbol of Chinese culture, which makes tea a perfect present.</p><br/>
  <p>After this fieldwork, our team narrowed down our design space to Chinese tea, an important element in Chinese culture. We conducted literary research, which was mainly centered on an article from International Journal of Design about a case study of relationship between tea culture and social interaction design. In this article, it puts forward the meaning of tea activity in Taiwan. Drinking tea for Chinese is not only for physiological needs, but also emotional and social needs. However, the way to make tea, and have tea, is changing with all the tectonic shift in today’s digital word. We should think about using interaction design to develop this traditional culture. </p><br/>
  <p>We also did an object study, which was all about tea. We asked one subject who is a tea lover to do a routine interaction with tea. We kept digital imagery documentary and figured out some design qualities of tea: drinkable, regional, salutary, carrier of Chinese culture, spiritual practice and value.</p><br/>
  <p>Then we did the second round of fieldwork. We interviewed three people talking about tea and drinking tea in America using the method of object probes. At the same time we did a second survey, which is specifically focused on Chinese tea for overseas Chinese. Data and stories we obtained from these gave us direct inspiration, which will be explained in the concept section in detail.</p><br/>
