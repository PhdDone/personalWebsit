  <div class="title">Design Challenge</div><br/>  
  <p>Our design focuses on applecare service system, which provides apple products 
repair services. During our previous experience with applecare, we have realized it always takes customers more time if there is no apple store near them. They communicate with 
service providers through phone call. People who cannot express themselves well in 
English always struggle to understand and make people understand what their problems are rather than fixing the problems. We are aiming to redesign an online service system for foreigners in The United States and who cannot request service through face-to-face communication.</p><br />
   
<div class="title">Design Process</div><br/>
<p>First, we conducted a role-play research,
in which we replayed the last experience we had within applecare service. Our intention was to find out what the process was and where the problems were. Two of our participants played this situation, which was from one people’s reallife experience and we took notes. After 
the role-play, we analyzed and defined the 
problem space with more details.</p><br />
<p>The real-life repair process (object :  MAC   charger):</p>
<p>1st stage: online chat but be told to call 
the customer service number;</p>
<p>2nd stage: call the number, be asked about 
series NO. and warranty, be asked about 
what the problem is, be asked to do some 
tests on the broken charger, be told will 
receive an email;</p>
<p>3rd stage: receive an email, read the in-
struction (step one, step two, etc.), go to 
the link, login, enter the series NO.;</p>
<p>4th stage: receive the new charger, use 
the second label to free return the broken 
one (using the same box);</p>
<p>5th stage: go back to the system and 
confirm, wait until there is a confirmation 
information shown on the system (need 
to check this by customer)</p><br />
<p>The problems we observed:</p>
<p>1. time consuming; 2. inefficient communication without face-to-face contact; 3. machine reply is disturbing; 4. language problems.</p><br />
<p>The insights we got:</p>
<p>1. customers prefer everything happening online; 2. customers don’t want to touch the technical issues; 3. instead of machine response, prefer human response.</p><br />
<p>The concepts we got:</p>
<p>1. efficient online chat/video chat; 2. one-click request submission.</p><br />
<p>Based on the critiques we got, we 
redesigned our initial ideas and came 
up with a final concept, a blueprint and a 
customer journey map. The final video prototype is shown above.</p><br />
