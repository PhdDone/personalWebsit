  <div class="title">Design Challenge</div><br/>  
  <p>This project follows the design problem from CHI2012 design competition:   Space, Place, Threshold: Considering the Experience of Home from Within and Without. Also we will focus on thinking about new solutions to solve problem for new group of people.</p>
  <br />
<div class="title">Design Process</div><br/>  
  <p>We defined our target people as blind people because the implications of home for blind people maybe helpful and also we defined the design context as eating environment because eating experience is important in domestic experience and it can occur both within and without home. So thinking about the relationship between them and come up with the design to enhance blind people's eating experience became our restated design problem.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We did interviews with four blind people and got the information that the places of the tableware is a big problem for them. Also from the literature research we did, we found it's hard for blind people to know the changing environment like the places of the furniture, the activities of people around them, etc. We also found related design works to get the inspiration of how to design other elements like sound, touch or smell to give the blind people information.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We did a lot of brain storm to come up with ideas of design around the table, like smart table, intuitive tableware or smart gloves. Finally we picked the idea of portable place mat, which can help to bring the eating habits inside of home outside, and make the eating environment familiar and comfortable for blind people.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After user tests, we found the way we gave out the information of the tableware's information is not that help, so we did the second round of interviews to understand what are the specific difficulties the blind people have with locating the tableware. We added a &quot;watch&quot; to our design, which can tell the user there is a new stuff on the mat and also can serve as a direction definition tool for the blind people to define their preference of the places. Waiters can see the labels of the defined areas and then put the tableware according to the blind people's preference.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our whole design process and the final design are in the slide show above.</p><br />
<div class="title">Reflection</div><br/>  
  <p>That is really a challenge for our team to design for the users who can't see the interface and at the same time the problem of design for home is also hard because of the familiarity we have towards the concept &quot;Home&quot;. Our team is still working on the project and improving the design, hoping  in someway our work can help the blind people with their daily life. </p><br/>
