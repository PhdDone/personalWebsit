  <div class="title">Design Challenge</div><br/>  
  <p>At the heart of a child’s toy is the interaction that the child has with the toy. It is this engagement of activity where the child’s imagination is lived out in their mind that true interactivity takes place. We strove to capture the imagination of a child and implement the interactivity that they might have with a particular toy. Our aim is to bring this imagination to life using Arduino technology, with two physical inputs and two outputs.</p>
  <br />
  
<div class="title">Design Process</div><br/>
  <p>Before we began the process of design, we both observed toys in toy stores. We noted how toys reflect societal expectations on boys and girls. We photographed toys during this process, then shared the photographs and 
notes with each other. After the toy store observations, we decided to work on an existing Lego set.</p><br />
<p>Kevin has two small daughters, ages six and three. He observed them playing with Legos, watching how they interacted with them, and what their process was of building with Legos. Initially, the children dumped a tub of Legos on the floor. First, they searched for the pieces they wish to build with. They typically began with a large base to build onto, whether 
it was a large green Lego platform, or a smaller flat Lego piece. By this point they had determined what they wanted to build. When they finished their Lego creation, they either played with it for a short period of time, or they tore it apart and created something different. Lego creations that tended to be 
kept in tact were houses and cars. If an adult created something for the child, the Lego creation was typically kept in tact for several days. We also gathered a number of articles on Legos. One article in particular was about DigiBlox, research that combined Lego-like blocks and Arduino interactions. Their research suggested that when these blocks were constructed that interactions would be created. This article was also an inspiration in our approach.
</p><br />
<p>The insights we got are: 1) children need interactions between toys and them, as well as the other people and themselves; 2) children   have expectations of the toys they interact with, like a “should be” reaction, place or sound; 3) parents need a chance to participate in children’s playing with toys, and they need educational toy sets.</p><br/>
<p>The final concept of LEGO Police Car is 
built with Arduino Lilypad. As shown on the left, it has two inputs: light sensor and button; and it has two outputs: siren speaker and a LED. When children touch the light sen-
sor, it will activate the LED, and 
when children push the button the 
speaker will play a siren sound. Parents can use this toy to educate children about the relationship between the “bad guys” and policeman. The added interaction will also 
increase the enjoyment of playing with LEGO.  The final video prototype is shown above. </p><br/>
